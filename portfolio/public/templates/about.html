  <h4>About</h4>
  <p>Whilst at University, I became extremely interested in cryptocurrency that lead me to building a small personal cryptoinvestment portfolio. This sparked an interest and began a journey in which I found I had a desire to better my understanding of coding with a view to building websites and apps. After graduating I did some online courses and eventually decided to enroll in the Web Development Immersive (WDI) course at General Assembly in London. It is my desire is to become a junior developer and part of a team where I can learn and expand my knowledge in such a vast and exciting industry.</p>
